## Who am I

I am a PhD Student at Indiana University Bloomington working on computer security, advised by [Professor XiaoFeng Wang](https://homes.luddy.indiana.edu/xw7/). My research interests involve system security, vulnerability discovery, static analysis, symbolic execution, fuzzing, automatic exploit generation, AI for security, and so on. Besides, I also play CTF with [r3kapig](https://r3kapig.com/).
