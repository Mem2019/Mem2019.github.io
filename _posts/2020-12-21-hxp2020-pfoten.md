## 0x00 Overview

Last weekend I have played hxp 2020 as r3kapig. The challenges are very good. I have solved 3 challenges: `Secure Program Config`, `still-printf` and `pfoten`. Among these challenges, I think `pfoten` is quite worthy to do a full write-up. The challenge creates a file as *swap space*, so that some of the memory will be putted into this file when physical memory is not enough and will be then fetched from this file when being used again. The problem is this file is writable by any user. Therefore, when privileged memory like code of a root process is putted into this swap space, we can actually tamper it to our shellcode, so when it is executed again, we can execute arbitrary code in root privilege.

## 0x01 Vulnerability

Reading `rcS` file, we can see following code, which is related to the challenge.

 ```bash
dd if=/dev/zero bs=1M count=10 of=/swap status=none
# create a 10M file /swap with content zeros

losetup /dev/loop0 /swap
# https://linux.die.net/man/8/losetup
# set /swap as loop device /dev/loop0
# in order to use /swap as swap space

mkswap /dev/loop0 >/dev/null
swapon /dev/loop0 >/dev/null
# https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mkswap.8.html
# set /dev/loop0 as *swap space*
# so file /swap is *swap space* now
 ```

However, file `/swap` is writable by any user.

```
-rw-rw-rw-    1 0        0         10485760 Dec 21 08:10 swap
```

## 0x02 Proof of Concept

In order to prove my idea, I have written following PoC to see what will be putted into `/swap` file.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <memory.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>


int main(int argc, char const *argv[])
{
	for (int i = 0; ; ++i)
	{
		char* buffer = mmap(NULL, 1024*1024, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
		memset(buffer, 'A', 1024*1024);
		printf("%d\n", i);
		system("strings /swap");
	}
	return 0;
}
```

After a few iterations, we can see many interesting outputs from `strings` command, and some of the strings come from the `busybox` binary, so my idea is confirmed: `/swap` will indeed be used to store virtual memory content at disk.

## 0x03 Exploitation

I have come up with several exploitation ideas:

1. Store kernel heap memory into `/swap`, and rewrite `cred` structure to escalate privilege of our process.
2. Store kernel code into `/swap`, and modify these code to privilege escalating shellcode, and call these code in our process. (e.g. some `ioctl` handler in kernel)
3. Store code of `init` process (which is a root process) into `/swap`, and rewrite them to shellcode.

However, the data to be stored into `/swap` have to meet some requirements:

1. It cannot be used when our exploit is running, because Linux only stores infrequently used memory into disk.
2. It can be used after the content is tampered, otherwise modifying it cannot cause any effect.

Intuitively, kernel heap should be quite frequently-used, so I would guess that first idea might not work properly. I have not tried the second idea but the third one.

I have already seen `busybox` strings in PoC outputs, and that means we can already dump process memory of this ELF executable file into `/swap`. Note that all utilities like `/init` in this kernel image is linking to the `/bin/busybox`, and we also know that Linux will share read-only memory pages to same physical memory among all processes of same ELF file in order to save physical memory (e.i. `r-x` page of `sh` and `init` are shared). Thus, we can conclude we already have the ability to modify `r-x` page contents in `init` process. Therefore, I tried the third idea first and solved the challenge.

Then next question is what to write. The idea is to search binary sequences using `memmem` in `/swap`, and replace that sequences to our shellcode. Such sequences can be found by putting `busybox` binary into IDA. 

Firstly, since `init` run commands in `inittab` and it should wait until `sh` exits, I may search and modify code around https://github.com/mirror/busybox/blob/master/init/init.c#L594 to modify the code that will be executed after `sh` exits. However, I failed to find such code in `/swap`. I guess maybe that page is used frequently when our exploit runs(?). Then I found a function where `busybox` call `SYS_exit`, with sequences `48 63 FF B8 E7 00 00 00 0F 05 BA 3C 00 00 00`. I then modified the contents into `0x100` bytes of `\xcc`. This time kernel panic raises with message saying `Code: cc cc cc ...`. 

```
[   64.302748] RIP: 0033:0x4d12a7
[   64.303098] Code: cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc cc <cc>c
[   64.303680] RSP: 002b:00007ffe2c26b998 EFLAGS: 00000246
```

Nice! That means our shellcode is executed by `init` process! However, I admit this is quite accidental, because according to `rip` value shown in error message, it is the function after the `SYS_exit` function that is executed by `init` instead of the exit function in my original thought. After some trying, I found the first instruction being executed is `0x4d12a6`, which suggests `init` is just returning from a `syscall` at `0x4d12a4` before executing the tampered code. Nonetheless, we can actually execute code in `init` process! Firstly I tried `execve("/bin/sh", NULL, NULL)`, but that also causes panic in `sh`. I guess the reason is `/bin/sh` also links to `/bin/busybox`, which is already tampered by us. Thus secondly I tried to write shellcode that open and read `/dev/fd0` (e.i. `flag.txt`), and write its content to `stdout`. This time it works locally! Although we may need to run it several times to find the binary sequences, probably because there is some probability for Linux to store that code into `/swap`.

## 0x04 Remote Environment

However, the exploit does not work properly remotely: it encounters `EOF` at around 400+ iterations. Initially I thought it is because when process is out-of-memory, whole kernel is killed instead of that one process, unlike local environment. But even if I `munmap` the pages, it still encounters `EOF` at around same number of iterations. And even if I decreases the size of `mmap`, it still encounters `EOF` at same iteration. This is weird. Finally I tried to increase the size of `mmap` to `0x100000`, and this time I got the flag at last 2 minutes of the CTF.

Nonetheless, I still have no idea why such `EOF` occurs.

The final exploit is shown below:
